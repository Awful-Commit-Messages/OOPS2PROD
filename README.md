# OOPS2PROD

What if every NPC in a game was powered by their own AI agent with secrets, goals, and limited knowledge? We built it. The story writes itself.

## Requirements

1. Anthropic API key: https://www.anthropic.com/learn/build-with-claude
    - We spent less than $3 testing and demoing this project.
2. Docker Compose and a modern web browser
3. Internet access (uses LLM API calls)

## Starting the Server with Docker Compose

1. Create a `.env` file with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=` followed by your API key (no quotes)
2. `docker compose up`
3. Open `localhost:8000` in your browser
